Airmed
Cellular Oscillation Intelligence

Overview
Airmed is a proprietary systems modeling platform for understanding cellular dynamics and phase transitions over time. Named for the Celtic goddess of healing—keeper of all 365 herbs and guardian of the Well of Sláine—this tool brings clarity and transparency to complex biological modeling.
Built for researchers, clinicians, and organizations who need deterministic, auditable, reproducible results.

What It Does

Models cellular state through a unified input framework
Tracks phase transitions across seven distinct system states
Provides governance controls that prevent risky actions and log all decisions
Exports full audit trails for regulatory and research compliance
Runs deterministically — same inputs always produce same outputs


The Seven Phases
Airmed classifies system state into one of seven phases:
Homeostasis → Drift → Insult → Propagation → Stasis → Compensation → Collapse
Each phase represents a distinct mode of system behavior. Transitions are determined by internal thresholds—fully transparent within the licensed software.
